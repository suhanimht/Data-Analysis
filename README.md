# Exploratory Data Analysis of Spotify Tracks and Their Genres
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Spotify tracks, utilizing two datasets: tracks and spotifyfeatures. These datasets provide comprehensive information about individual tracks, including various attributes such as popularity, duration, explicit content, danceability, energy, and more.
## Dataset Overview
Tracks Dataset
The tracks dataset comprises the following columns:
id: Unique identifier for the track
name: Track name
popularity: Popularity score of the track
duration_ms: Duration of the track in milliseconds
explicit: Indicator of explicit content (True/False)
artists: Names of the artists associated with the track
id_artists: Unique identifiers of the artists
release_date: Release date of the track
danceability: Danceability score
energy: Energy score
key: Key of the track
loudness: Loudness of the track
mode: Modality of the track (Major/Minor)
speechiness: Speechiness score
acousticness: Acousticness score
instrumentalness: Instrumentalness score
liveness: Liveness score
valence: Valence score
tempo: Tempo of the track
time_signature: Time signature of the track

## Spotify Features Dataset
The spotifyfeatures dataset comprises the following columns:

genre: Genre of the track
artist_name: Name of the artist
track_name: Name of the track
track_id: Unique identifier for the track
popularity: Popularity score of the track
acousticness: Acousticness score
danceability: Danceability score
duration_ms: Duration of the track in milliseconds
energy: Energy score
instrumentalness: Instrumentalness score
key: Key of the track
liveness: Liveness score
loudness: Loudness of the track
mode: Modality of the track (Major/Minor)
speechiness: Speechiness score
tempo: Tempo of the track
time_signature: Time signature of the track
valence: Valence score

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of this EDA project include:

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.
Ensure consistency in data types.
Address any data quality issues.

### Descriptive Statistics:
Generate summary statistics for key variables.
Explore the distribution of popularity scores.

### Feature Relationships:
Analyze relationships between musical features (danceability, energy, etc.).
Investigate correlations and dependencies.

### Temporal Analysis:
Examine trends in track releases over time.
Assess the popularity evolution of genres.

### Genre Exploration:
Understand the distribution of genres.
Explore genre-specific characteristics.

### Visualization:
Create visualizations (plots, charts) to convey insights effectively.
